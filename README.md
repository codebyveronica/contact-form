## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how to validate the email format with RegEx. With this project, I also practiced creating forms and validating them.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing creating and validating forms, because I believe it is the basis. And I will also continue practicing HTML and CSS to improve my skills more and more, and also continue learning and practicing Java Script.

### Useful resources
